# Echo-State-Network-Reservoir-Computing
Echo State Network is a single layer, recurrent neural network. 

it trains a readout (linear) neuron to produce the output, with inputs beeing the states of the reservoir neurons.

because of the recurrent nature of the model, it has information from previous states. 

this code is the implementation of the paper echo state network by jaeger, u can download the paper at https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=0uztVbMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=0uztVbMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C
